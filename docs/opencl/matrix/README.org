* Matrix sparse operation


From more structured to unstructured:
- DIA (Diagonal)
- ELL (Ellpack)
- CSR (Compressed Row)
- HYB (Hybrid)
- COO (Coordinate)

** ELLPACK

Inefficient when row length varies.


** Comments

- Transform a CSR to HYB takes O(10-100)
- If the solver is O(100-1000) then go for HYB
- If the solver is O(10), go for CSR/COO
